a) * tuples is a immutable
   * it is value fix no change
   * it is value change method convert list and change the value then convert tuple 

   * list is a mutable
   * it is every time change the values
    

c) *exception handling is a identify the which type of error and proper solving

  eg:-
	  try:
            num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
            if num > 0:
               if num%2 == 0:
                   print("this number even number")
                
               else:
                   print("this number is odd")
            
          except ValueError :
             print("enter the correct input")

d) local variable
   * local variable are define the function
   * it is variable are working only function inside
  
   eg:- 
      def sum():
          x=10
          y=20
          print(x + y)

sum()
 
global variable
* global variable are define the function outside
* it is variable define the program top

eg:-
   
   s =20
   t =30
   print(s + t)





e,f) SUPERVISED
   *supervised leaning is a structured machine language
   *it is data predict data set standard output
   * it is data predict depends in Features
   

  UNSUPERVISED
  * unsupervised leaning is not a structured machine language
  * it is data predict depends in data set
  * it is predict time data set unwanted rows and column affect in output 
  * it is data set check needed rows and column

 
g)  * data select and uploas
    * write the program 
    * data chek the errors and solveing
    * needed the algorithms import the library
    * training the data
    * predict

h) * svm , logisregrssion , randomforestclassifier, decisiontreeclassifier, naive bayes ,svc ,k mean
